  freedDialogue: "\"The path ahead is a long one, thief. But you cannot undo the
    harm done by mankind alone. Noor\u2019s light returns to the world, not as salvation,
    but as witness. We Jinn... we were once the guardians of breath and bone, flame
    and root. Now we are ghosts of a ruined bloodline. If you truly mean to free
    the others, reckless ambition will not suffice. You must learn reverence... and
    restraint.\""
