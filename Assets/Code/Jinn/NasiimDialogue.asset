  sensedDialogue: "\u201CBefore the end came, he was the last to speak. And when
    his voice was sealed, silence bled across the land. Where he waits, even memory
    holds its breath.\""
  freedDialogue: '"He is the last to remain here. He who warned the kings. He who
    pleaded for their mercy. When they turned away, he ignited the heavens with fire.
    Upon his fall, the stars disappeared, and the sands became empty. He has waited
    long, thief... but not for forgiveness."'
